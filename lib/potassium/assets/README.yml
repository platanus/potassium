        Assuming you've just cloned the repo, run this script to setup the project in your
        machine:

            $ ./bin/setup

        It assumes you have a machine equipped with Ruby, <%= get(:database).to_s.titleize %>, etc. If not, set up
        your machine with [boxen].

        The script will do the following among other things:

        - Install the dependecies
        - Prepare your database
        - Adds heroku remotes

        After the app setup is done you can run it with [Heroku Local]

            $ heroku local

        [Heroku Local]: https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-local
        [boxen]: http://github.com/platanus/our-boxen

        The project is setup to run tests
        in [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/platanus/<%= get(:dasherized_app_name) %>/tree/master)

        You can also run the test locally simulating the production environment using docker.
        Just make sure you have docker installed and run:

            bin/cibuild
    deployment:
      title: "Deployment"
      body: |
        This project is pre-configured to be (easily) deployed to Heroku servers, but needs you to have the Potassium binary installed. If you don't, then run:

            $ gem install potassium

        Then, make sure you are logged in to the Heroku account where you want to create the app and run

            $ potassium install heroku --force

        this will create the app on heroku, create a pipeline and link the app to the pipeline.

        You'll still have to manually log in to the heroku dahsboard, go to the new pipeline and 'configure automatic deploys' using Github
        You can run the following command to open the dashboard in the pipeline page

            $ heroku pipelines:open

        Remember to connect each stage to the corresponding branch:

        1. Staging -> Master
        2. Production -> Production

        That's it. You should already have a running app and each time you push to the corresponding branch, the system will (hopefully) update accordingly.
    style_guide:
      title: "Style Guides"
      body: |
        The style guides are enforced through a self hosted version of [Hound CI](http://monkyeci.platan.us). The style configuration can also be used locally
        in development runing `rubocop` or just using the rubocop integration for your text editor of choice.

        You can add custom rules to this project just adding them to the `.ruby-style.yml` file.
    mailing:
      title: "Sending Emails"
      body: |
        The emails can be send through the gem `<%= get(:mailer_gem_name) %>` using the `<%= get(:mailer_delivery_method) %>` delivery method.
        All the `action_mailer` configuration can be found at `config/mailer.rb`, which is loaded only on production environments.

        All emails should be sent using background jobs, by default we install `delayed_job` for that purpuse.

        #### Testing in staging

        If you add the `EMAIL_RECIPIENTS=` environmental variable, the emails will be intercepted and redirected to the email in the variable.
